# Welcome to the Python Files Repository! 🐍

Hey there! 👋 This is a collection of Python notebooks or Files that will take you on an exciting journey through the realms of data science and machine learning. Within this repository, you'll find a collection of notebooks on various intriguing projects, ranging from **Customer Churn Prediction** to **Stock Price Predictions** and even **Sentiment Analysis**!

## 📁 Python Projects

Here is a glimpse of projects that I've done using Python:

1. **Customer Churn Prediction** 📊
   - Dive into the world of customer behavior analysis! Using ANN, we find out if the credit card customer is going to be churned or not. Click [here](https://github.com/dakshbhatnagar/python_files/blob/main/JupyterNotebooks/customer-churn-prediction-anns%20(1).ipynb) 

2. **Stock Price Predictions** 📈
   - Stock Price predictions are always fun to make. Using Backtesting, a Stastical Model and a Deep Learning Network, we do exactly that. Check out the project [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/bhatnagardaksh/stock-predictions-with-backtesting-arima-and-gru)

3. **Sentiment Analysis** 📝
   - Understanding Sentiment of others can be tough. Let's make it a breeze. Click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/bhatnagardaksh/youtube-comments-analysis-updated) to find out how

**And Many More!** 🚀
